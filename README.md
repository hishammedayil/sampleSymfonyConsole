# Problem Statement

We want to build a calculator that receives two numbers and does an operation.

We do not know which kind of operations we want to do yet, we will get them in the future (future business requirements) and this calculator may have really complex operations.

Current planned operations are:

- Sum
- VAT (amount, vat rate)

Different team will be adding parallel operations to this calculator so it must be easily extendable and using dependency injection.
